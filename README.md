Also, make sure to check INPUT.md to learn how to use this program

This program is very GPU-intensive, so if the video resolution is high or your GPU is not high-end Windows might reboot the driver thinking it has got stuck (TDR), don't letting the program finish. If that happens, you can manually disable or delay this behaviour by modifying the Windows registry.
